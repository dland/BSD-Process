=head1 NAME

BSD::Process - Information about running processes on BSD platforms

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.06 of BSD::Process,
released 2011-04-10.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use BSD::Process;

  my $proc = BSD::Process->new;
  print $proc->rssize, " resident set size\n"; # as a method
  print "This process has made $proc->{minflt} page reclaims\n";

  print $proc->time, " seconds spent on the CPU (user+system)\n";
  $proc->refresh;
  print "And now $proc->{time} seconds\n"; # as an attribute

  # oneliner shortcut
  perl -MBSD::Process=P -le 'print P->ppid, " is my parent"';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<BSD::Process> creates Perl objects that render the information
the BSD kernel maintains about current processes.  These may then
be queried, extracted and reported upon. This allows a more natural
style of programming (as opposed to scraping the output of ps(1)).

The information is retrieved via the C<kvm> subsystem, and will
thus work even if the F</proc> filesystem is not mounted.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item new

Creates a new C<BSD::Process> object. Takes an optional numeric
value to specify the pid of the target process, otherwise the
current process is assumed.

A second optional parameter, a reference to a hash, supplies
additional information governing the creation of the object.

Currently, one key is available:

B<resolve> - indicates whether uids and gids should be resolved to
their symbolic equivalents (for instance, 0 becomes "root").

Passing the hash reference as the only parameter works as may be
expected: the pid of the current process will be used implicitly.

  my $init = BSD::Process->new(1); # get info about init
  print "children of init have taken $init->{childtime} seconds\n";

  # get process info of process's parent, resolving ids
  my $parent = BSD::Process->new(
    BSD::Process->new->parent_pid,
    {resolve => 1},
  );

Once the object has been created, the various process attributes
can be examined via method calls or as hash keys, see below.

At the current time C<new> is implemented in terms of C<info> (see
below), but may in the future be implemented in terms of lazy
fetching.

=item P

Stashes a global BSD::Process variable, for use in one-liners. By
default, the current process is referenced, but any process may
be specified via its process id.

  print P->rssize, "\n"; # resident set size of running process
  P(P->ppid);            # now refer to parent
  print P->rssize, "\n"; # rss of parent
  P(1);                  # talking about init(8)

But more likely:

  perl -MBSD::Process=P -le 'print P->rssize';

As this function is implemented in terms of a global private
variable, it is adequate for oneliners. It should not be used in
a threaded program, use objects instead.

=item info, process_info

Returns the entire set of process attributes and their values,
as specified by a process identifier (or I<pid>).

The input value is numified. Thus, if a some random string is passed
in, it will be coerced to 0, and you will receive the process
information of process 0 (the swapper). If no parameter is passed,
the pid of the running process is assumed.

A hash reference may be passed as an optional second parameter,
see C<new> for a list of what is available.

  my $proc = BSD::Process::info( $$, {resolve => 1} );
  print $proc->{uid};
  # on my system, prints 'david', rather than 1001

A reference to a hash is returned, which is basically a C<BSD::Process>
object, without all the object-oriented fluff around it. The keys
are documented below in the METHODS section, however, only the short
names are available, the longer descriptive names are not defined.

If the pid does not (or does no longer) correspond to process, undef
is returned.

The routine C<info> is not exportable (since many programs will
no doubt already have a routine named C<info>). Instead, it is
exportable under the name C<process_info>.

=item list, process_list

Returns an (unsorted) array of pids of all the running processes
on the system. Note: fleet-footed processes may have disappeared
between the time the snapshot is taken and the time the code
subsequently gets around to asking for more information about
them. On the other hand, getting this list is very fast. If you
want the set of current processes on the system decoded as
C<BSD::Process> objects, you should be looking at the C<all>
meta-constructor.

The routine C<list> is not exportable. It may be exported under
the name C<process_info>.

  my @pid = BSD::Process::list;
  for my $p (@pid) {
    my $proc =  BSD::Process::info($p);
    print "$p $proc->{ppid}\n"; # print each pid and its parent pid
  }

The set of processes may be restricted by specifying a condition,
defined as a key/value pair to C<list()>. The following restrictions
are available:

=over 4

=item uid, effective_user_id

Return the list of pids that are owned by the specified effective
user id. The uid may be specified in the symbolic or numeric form.

  my @uid_pid  = BSD::Process::list(uid => 1001);
  my @root_pid = BSD::Process::list(uid => 'root');

=item pgid, process_group_id

Return the processes that belong to the specified process group.

  my @pgid_pid = BSD::Process::list(process_group_id => 378);

=item sid, process_session_id

Return the processes that belong to the specified process session.

=back

=item all

Return a references to a hash of C<BSD::Process> objects representing the
current running processes. The hash keys are the process pids.
The following program prints out the 10 processes that consume the most
physical memory.

  use BSD::Process;

  my $all = BSD::Process::all;
  my $want = 10;
  for my $pid (
    sort {$all->{$b}{rssize} <=> $all->{$a}{rssize}}
    keys %$all
  ) {
    my $proc = $all->{$pid};
    print $proc->command_name, ' ',  $proc->resident_set_size,
      "Kb owned by $proc->{login}\n";
    last unless --$want;
  }

This routine runs more slowly than C<list()>, since it has to
instantiate the process objects. It may help to think of C<all()>
as a meta-new constructor, since it creates many new BSD::Process
objects in one fell swoop.

This routine accepts the same parameters as C<list()>. Thus, one is
able to restrict the set of objects returned. In addition, it also
accepts the C<resolve> parameter, to indicate that uids and gids
should be represented as symbolic names rather than numeric values.

  my @own = BSD::Process::all(uid => 1000);

  my @session = BSD::Process::all(sid => 632, resolve => 1);

=item attr

Returns the list of available attributes of a C<BSD::Process>
object. You can use this to pretty-print an object:

  my $self = BSD::Process->new;
  for my $attr (BSD::Process::attr) {
    printf "%11s %s\n", $attr, $self->{$attr};
  }

=item attr_len

The problem with the above program is that on different platforms
and operating system versions, the length of the longest attribute
might not be 11.  In this case, one may employ C<attr_len> to obtain
the length of the longest attribute name. The above program then
becomes:

  my $len = BSD::Process::attr_len;
  my $self = BSD::Process->new;
  for my $attr (BSD::Process::attr) {
    printf "%*s %s\n", $len, $attr, $self->{$attr};
  }

=item attr_alias

Returns the list of long aliases of the attributes.

=item max_kernel_groups

Returns the maximum number of groups to which a process may belong.
This is probably not of direct importance to the average Perl
programmer, but it eases calculating the number of regression tests
to be run in a cross-platform manner.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item refresh

Refreshes the information of a C<BSD::Process> object. For
instance, the following snippet shows a very accurate way
of measuring elapsed CPU time:

  my $proc  = BSD::Process->new;
  my $begin = $proc->runtime; # microseconds
  lengthy_calculation();

  $proc->refresh;
  my $elapsed = $proc->runtime - $begin;
  print "that took $elapsed microseconds of CPU time\n";

The method may be chained:

  my $runtime = $proc->refresh->runtime;

It may also be used with the C<P> shortcut.

  P; # to initialise
  lengthy_calculation();
  P->refresh;

=item resolve

Switches symbolic resolution on or off.

  my $proc = BSD::Process->new;
  print "$proc->{uid}\n";
  $proc->resolve;
  print "$proc->{uid}\n";

Note that changing the resolve setting will result in the
object being C<refresh>ed.

=back

=head1 PROCESS ATTRIBUTES

The following methods may be called on a C<BSD::Process> object.
Each process attribute may be accessed via two methods, a longer,
more descriptive name, or a terse name (following the member
name in the underlying C<kinfo_proc> C struct).

Furthermore, you may also interpolate the attribute (equivalent to
the terse method name) directly into a string. This can lead to
simpler code. The following three statements are equivalent:

  print "rss=", $p->resident_set_size;
  print "rss=", $p->rssize;
  print "rss=$p->{rssize};

A modification of a value in the underlying hash of the object
has no corresponding effect on the system process it represents.

Older kernels do not track as many process attributes as more
modern kernels. In these cases, the value -1 will be returned.

In the following list, the key B<F5+> means that the method
returns something useful in FreeBSD 5.x or better. The key
B<F6> means the method returns something useful for FreeBSD
6.x and beyond.

=over 4

=item process_args, args

The command with all its arguments as a string. When the process
args are unavailable, the name of the executable in brackets is
returned (same as in the F<ps> program). This may happen when the
length of the arguments exceeds the kernel limit set with the
C<kern.ps_arg_cache_limit> kernel setting. (This is usually 256,
for more information check the manual page for the F<sysctl>

These attributes (only available in FreeBSD 6.x) store the resource
usage of the child processes spawned by this process. Currently,
the kernel only fills in the information for the the C<utime_ch>
and C<stime_ch> fields (and hence the C<time_ch> value is derived
from them).

In theory (and in practice as far as I can tell) C<time_ch> is
equal to C<childtime>.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

B<kern.proc.pid is corrupt>: a "can't happen" error when
attempting to retrieve the information of a process. If this
occurs, I'd like to know how you managed it.

B<kvm error in all()/list()>: another "can't happen" error when
asking the system to return the information about a process.

B<kvm error in list(): proc size mismatch (nnn total, nnn chunks)>:
you have upgraded a system across major versions, for instance 4.x
to 5.x, but the published system header files belong to the previous
version.

=head1 NOTES

Currently, FreeBSD versions 4 through 7 are supported (and 8
probably works out of the box). Support for NetBSD and OpenBSD may
be added in future versions.

=head1 SEE ALSO

=over 4

=item L<BSD::Sysctl>

Read and write kernel variables. With these two modules, there
should be much less need for writing shell scripts that scrape
the output of ps(1) and sysctl(8).

=item L<Proc::ProcessTable>

Seems to be a fairly wide cross-platform module. Goes into
a fair amount of depth, but not as much as C<BSD::Process>
does in its own particular niche. Also, FreeBSD has moved
away from the F</proc> filesystem.

Definitely the module to use if you need to go
multi-platform.

=item L<Solaris::Procfs>

Information about processes on the Solaris platform. The
documentation indicates that it is not finished, however,
it does not appear to have been updated since 2003.

=item L<Win32::Process::Info>

Information about current processes on the Win32 platform.

=back

=head1 BUGS

Process arguments are not handled (current attempts result in
coredumps).

Not all of the ps(1) keywords are implemented. At the worst,
this (currently) means that you could not rewrite it in Perl.
This may be addressed in a future release.

Please report all bugs at
L<http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bugs.html?Dist=BSD-Process|rt.cpan.org>

Make sure you include the output from the following two commands:

  perl -MBSD::Process -le 'print $BSD::Process::VERSION'
  perl -V
